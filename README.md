# kshe-to-spotify

As a big fan of Classic Rock living in France, I am very frustrated by the lack of good classic rock radio we have. I spent four months in St Louis, MO, and I had the chance to listen to [KSHE 95](http://www.kshe95.com/) every day, playing some of my favorite classic rock tunes. Unfortunately, I can't listen to this radio in France as they block it. Fortunately, their website shows the tunes [currently playing](http://player.listenlive.co/20101/en/songhistory), as well as a few previous ones. I decided to scrap this page, make myself an empty [Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/ericda/playlist/3BCcE8T945z1MnfPWkFsfX), and automatically add in the KSHE tracks.

So far, I am able to:
 - Scrap KSHE's web page, and get a list of 10 songs they've played
 - Find the songs on Spotify thanks to their web API
 - Upload them to a playlist I created, making sure there is no duplicate

My next steps include:
 - Automate this with a cron (or use something smarter like Airflow) so the playlist keeps getting updated
 - Pull some stats about what's playing, and when, trying to predict the next song, or mood, who knows what ...

Feel free to ping me if you want to help!

## Installation
To make it work, here's what to do.

First, you'll need to setup your Spotify developer account, and register an app. Find how [here](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/). Once your app is created, you will have access to the following crendentials:
 - client_id
 - client_secret
 - redirect_uri

The app will need those to update tracks to your playlist. Copy the file ```.spotify-token.json.dist``` into ```.spotify-token.json``` and fill in these credentials. You will also need your spotify *user-id* (your username) and the *playlist-uri* to which you'll upload the tracks to.

Once you're good, follow these commands to start the server. 

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/ericdaat/kshe-to-spotify.git
cd kshe-to-spotify
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd flask-server
uwsgi wsgi.ini
```

The app should now be running on ```localhost:9999```.


## API
The calls supported so far are:
 - [GET] ```localhost:9999/```: Doesn't do much
 - [GET] ```localhost:9999/auth```: Authenticate for 3600 seconds
 - [GET] ```localhost:9999/update_playlist```: Updates the playlist with the latest songs
